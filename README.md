# Acropolis (recent fork of diaspora\*)

![Build Status](https://github.com/magicstone-dev/acropolis/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Acropolis was forked from diaspora\* in August 2021. The idea for the fork is to optimize toward community, that is making it as easy as possible to contribute. We're following a protocol that basically says if you are addressing a valid problem, your code gets merged. Everything else follows from that.

## Installation

We're running our test instance via Docker and docker-compose. If you'd like to do the same, please see [Production-Installation.md](/docs/Production-Installation.md). Note: Upgrades are still rough since there's no built-in upgrade process for docker-compose.

[YunoHost installation](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/acropolis_ynh) is coming soon.

## Development

To get setup for development, follow our [Dev Setup guide](INSTALLING.md)
